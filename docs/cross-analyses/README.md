# Cross-Framework Analyses

This directory is used to **write cross-framework analyses** between the three
framework families (spec-kit, BMAD, OpenSpec). It relies on the specific
analyses from [../framework-analyses/](../framework-analyses/).

## Structure

- **documents/** — Working documents, drafts and supporting materials for
  comparisons
- **by-theme/** — Cross-framework analyses organized by theme (concepts,
  processes, artifacts, etc.)
- **pairwise/** — Pairwise comparisons:
  - spec-kit vs BMAD
  - spec-kit vs OpenSpec
  - BMAD vs OpenSpec
- **summary/** — Global summary of cross-framework analyses and cross-cutting
  conclusions

## Usage

1. First complete the specific analyses (documents, glossaries, summaries per
   framework).
2. Produce comparisons in **by-theme** or **pairwise** depending on the chosen
   angle.
3. Consolidate results in **summary**.

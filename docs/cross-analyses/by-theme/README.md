# Thematic Cross-Framework Analyses

Comparisons between the three frameworks organized **by theme** (concepts,
processes, artifacts, governance, etc.).

Possible theme examples:

- Concepts and terminology
- Processes and workflows
- Artifacts and deliverables
- Roles and responsibilities
- Tooling / AI integration

Add a subdirectory or document for each theme covered.

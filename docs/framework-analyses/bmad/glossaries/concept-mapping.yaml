unique_concepts:
  - id: party-mode
    name: Party Mode
    description: >-
      Multi-agent collaboration in a single conversation where multiple
      specialized agents participate, orchestrated by BMad Master.
    why_unique: >-
      Agent-centric approach unique to BMAD. Other frameworks don't have
      multi-agent collaboration concept.

  - id: adversarial-review
    name: Adversarial Review
    description: >-
      Review technique where the reviewer MUST find issues, preventing
      confirmation bias by assuming problems exist.
    why_unique: >-
      Explicit quality technique forcing genuine analysis. Other frameworks
      have reviews but not this forced problem-finding approach.

  - id: agent-personas
    name: Agent Personas
    description: >-
      Named experts (John, Winston, Amelia, etc.) with distinct identities,
      communication styles, and specialized expertise.
    why_unique: >-
      Human-like collaboration model with personality. Other frameworks
      use commands or processes, not characterized agents.

  - id: step-file-architecture
    name: Step-File Architecture
    description: >-
      Micro-file workflow design where each step is self-contained, loaded
      just-in-time, and executed sequentially.
    why_unique: >-
      Implementation detail unique to BMAD enabling context isolation
      and reproducibility. Other frameworks use monolithic prompts.

  - id: tri-modal-workflows
    name: Tri-Modal Workflows
    description: >-
      Workflows supporting Create, Validate, and Edit modes for key artifacts
      like PRD.
    why_unique: >-
      Workflow flexibility pattern allowing different operation modes.
      Other frameworks typically have single-mode processes.

  - id: solutioning-phase
    name: Solutioning Phase
    description: >-
      Dedicated phase for preventing agent conflicts through Architecture
      Decision Records before implementation begins.
    why_unique: >-
      BMAD uniquely focuses on conflict prevention as a distinct phase.
      Other frameworks may have design but not explicit conflict prevention.

  - id: bmad-master
    name: BMad Master Agent
    description: >-
      Core orchestrator agent managing Party Mode and multi-agent coordination.
    why_unique: >-
      Meta-agent concept for orchestrating other agents. Unique to BMAD's
      multi-agent architecture.
